## Introduction

PRIME aims to enable physicians in the better management of the disease. This includes five main components:
1) a decision support tool based on PD treatment guidelines and ontologies
2) a prescription support tool which includes drug to drug, drug to gene and drug to protiens interaction checkers
3) automatic identification of similar cases with machine learning
4) functional tests to assess motor symptoms, specifically gait and tremor, using sensors
5) a physician dashboard to more easily monitor patient status and disease progress and make treatment decisions 

The specific repository provides the code and description for the 4) functional tests and specifically for the sensor data collection app
